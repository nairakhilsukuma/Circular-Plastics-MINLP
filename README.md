# Circular-Plastics-MINLP
Circular Plastics Superstructure. 
This research optimizes the design, process configuration, and operating framework of Plastic recycling processes.
A mix of data driven blackbox models and surrogate models have been developed to model plastics recycling superstructures.
A mixed integer nonlinear program is developed to minimize the cost of operation of the circular system. 
The proposed Equation Oriented (EO) framework expoilts a rigorous.
